The focus of this study is to analyze and understand the necessary conditions and logistics employed by SpaceX for the successful launch and landing of the Falcon 9 First Stage booster at a remarkably low budget of only US $65 million. The insights gained from this analysis will then be used to assist the upcoming space agency, SpaceY, in cost-saving measures and enhancing their competitiveness in the market.

SpaceX has gained recognition for its cost-efficient approach, with Falcon 9 rocket launches advertised on their website at a price of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers whose costs can exceed $165 million per launch. A major contributing factor to this cost reduction is SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage booster. Therefore, by accurately predicting if the first stage will successfully land, we can estimate the cost of a launch.

To achieve this objective, machine learning techniques will be employed, utilizing publicly available data to predict the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage. By determining the probability of successful landings, we can estimate the total cost for launches and evaluate the viability of SpaceY as a competitor to SpaceX.

The scope of this research encompasses several key areas. Firstly, we will investigate the selection criteria employed by SpaceX to determine the best orbit for satellite deployment, suitable launch sites, optimal payload selection, and the specific boosters to be utilized. Additionally, we will explore the various factors that contribute to the cost savings achieved by SpaceX, particularly in terms of logistics.

The research will delve into the interactions between different features that influence the success of first stage landings. By understanding the operating conditions and variables that contribute to favorable outcomes, we can establish the necessary parameters for successful launches and landings.

By undertaking this study, we aim to provide valuable insights and knowledge that will assist SpaceY in their quest to compete with SpaceX. By evaluating the cost-effectiveness and operational strategies employed by SpaceX, we can identify potential opportunities for SpaceY to enhance their own launch capabilities and cost-efficiency.

Ultimately, this project will shed light on the key factors contributing to the success of SpaceX's low-budget launches and pave the way for SpaceY to establish a strong position in the competitive space industry.
